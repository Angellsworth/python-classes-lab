## üß† Code Walkthrough

### Class Setup
```python
class Game:
```
Creates a blueprint for managing the game state and behavior.

### Initialization
```python
def __init__(self):
```
Sets up:
- `self.turn`: Tracks whose turn it is ("X" or "O")
- `self.board`: A dictionary of board positions (like "a1", "b2")
- `self.winner`: Tracks the winner (or None)
- `self.tie`: Tracks whether a tie has occurred

### Display Methods
```python
def print_board(self):
```
Displays the current game board in a readable format.

```python
def print_message(self):
```
Tells the user whose turn it is, if someone has won, or if the game ended in a tie.

### Game Loop
```python
def play_game(self):
```
Contains the main gameplay loop. Runs until someone wins or the board is full (tie).

### Player Interaction
```python
def get_move(self):
```
Prompts the player for a move. Validates the input before updating the board.

### Game Logic
```python
def check_for_winner(self):
```
Checks all possible win combinations to see if the current player has won.

```python
def check_for_tie(self):
```
Checks if the board is full and there's no winner.

```python
def switch_turn(self):
```
Alternates the value of `self.turn` between "X" and "O".
